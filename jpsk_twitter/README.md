-   Plan is to create charts covering social data related to the 2021.03.25 Japan-South Korea friendly

-   Thought about comparing it to the August 2011 friendly between the two teams but I don't think I can do a search that big, even with a developer account?

-   Since the crowd size will be relatively small (max 10,000), maybe I will experiment with focusing on things like geolocation.
